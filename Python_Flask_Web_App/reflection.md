What an assignment. This was a very long assignment. I struggled with this assignment mainly because it was a whole lot of reading. I mean a whoooole lot. After having read the docs very thoroughly, I was able to put most of the assignment together, but it was still touch and go. After everything was done came my least favorite part of the assignment, which was where we had to change all of our flash messages to match your tests. It should probably list the message in the module docs. Anyways things felt really great after writing it all, it became easy to understand and I really enjoyed it. The whole flask workflow is nice and streamlined.
