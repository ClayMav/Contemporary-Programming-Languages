This assignment was difficult for different reasons than the last one.
I think this assignment required a lot more though and a lot more reading of
the documentation, but required a lot less actual coding than the others.
The testing in this one was very difficult for me to understand, and also the
use of the reduce function was very very hard to understand. (also a stuggle to
find python docs about, but c had some which were helpful) 
I really excelled at the generator function I feel, it just felt really
natural.
