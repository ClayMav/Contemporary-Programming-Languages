I really hated Javascript before this assignment. Having used it now, the asynchrony really is appreciated. I have come to really enjoy some of the sugar that this language has. Callback functions make sense and most of all the (var) => {} syntax is actually something I will really miss when using other languages. I really like the strictness of scoping and the sort of free-flowing packages that come with npm. The hardest part of this assignment was just getting the child_process deal working properly. Other than that, it all felt really well written and the docs were an incredible resource. This assignment may have entirely changed my perspective on a wildly ridiculous, but well supported language.
