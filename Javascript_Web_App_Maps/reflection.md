This assignment was really a step off the deep end since we didn't have the usually wisely-tier docs. Having done a fair bit of DOM manipulation in the past, understanding what was happening was not the hard part. The difficult thing was that a lot of the questions I had were not answered through the docs I thought to check. I ended up looking at stackoverflow a lot and also looking at a lot of source code on GitHub. Hardest part of the assignment was getting movement to work properly, at first my instinct was to delete and replace the minions, but I quickly ditched that to try and make something that actually uses objects and properly uses the setLatLon functions in leaflet.
