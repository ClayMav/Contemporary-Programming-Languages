This program was not so difficult for me, but it was a really great intro to
documentation and unit testing in python, the hardest thing for me was
the walk function, there are a number of ways to solve the problem, and finding
the best version to represent Python in a readable way was tough

Having worked with Python, specifically Django, before, I was really cocky
at first, and trying to overcome previous experience is tough. A friend of mine
once told me to just "play the game", and hopefully my code will reflect that
most readable version.

The easiest thing about this was the testing since we were given reference
code to work from.
