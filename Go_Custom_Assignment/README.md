### Setting up the right version of Go
Refer to the setup instructions for [Homework 7](http://cpl.mwisely.xyz/hw/7/#setting-up-the-right-version-of-go).

### Running it
All you have to do is run in the root directory
```bash
$ GOROOT="$(pwd)/go" GOPATH="$(pwd)" ./go/bin/go run server/main.go
```

To see your progress, go to either `http://localhost:<port>` or to see the actual board, open the `client/index.html` file in your (grid-supported) brower of choice
