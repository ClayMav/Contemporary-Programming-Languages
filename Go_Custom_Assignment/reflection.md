I really enjoyed conceptualizing this assignment, and I wish I had a lot more time. I think I dreamt a little bit too large considering it is finals week and I have a million things to worry about. In general I enjoyed working more with Go and with servers. I think my largest struggle was trying to make the server stuff as approachable as possible. I feel like Go as a language does this very very well but theres a quote out there somewhere that for you to be able to explain something easily, you really need to understand it. Einstein I think. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that I hope I have another couple year of Go in me at minimum before I slave away doing C++. Have a really good time at Sandia, Wisely!
