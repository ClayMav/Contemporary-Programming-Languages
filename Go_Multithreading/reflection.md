This assignment was hard because for my entire career as a computer scientist, I have only ever done single threaded applications. Using multiple threads seems like a really good skill and learning it with Go was not really that bad as maybe I had thought it would be. The hardest part was getting all of the error checking for me. I think this assignments only real downfall for me was that it was assigned to be worked on over a long break which caused me to be a little lax on my working time.
