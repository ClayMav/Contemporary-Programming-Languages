# Reflection

## What parts of the assignment were challenging for you?

Trying to understand code I hadn't written was hard at first, but after I started off, it all made sense.

## What parts of the assignment were easy for you?

Having had some experience with unit testing before, I didn't really have much difficulty in writing the tests.

## How did you overcome challenges?

A little bit of cout debugging and a lot of reading over the code.

## What made the easy parts so easy?

I think that fixing the disk1 problem was really quite simple, but that was mainly because it was clear through tests that it was off by 2.

## What do you feel you learned by completing the assignment?

I think that was great at setting me up for the submission process and showed me a great way to set up an efficient workflow. Another thing this did was give me a chance to see what kind of structure I am to expect from the assignments to follow in this class.
